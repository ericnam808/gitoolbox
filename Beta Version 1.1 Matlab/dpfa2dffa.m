% [Description]
% This method converts a DPFA to a DFFA. This requires such condition
% fullfilled that the DPFA should be well defined which means the
% probability of strings entering and leaving a state should be identical.
% Input: a well defined DPFA, Number of total strings in sample
% Output: corresponding DFFA

function dffa = dpfa2dffa(dpfa, numOfStrings)
%DPFA2DFFA converts DPFA to DFFA
    lenOfState = length(dpfa.FiniteSetOfStates);
    freq = [];
    SetOfState = dpfa.FiniteSetOfStates;
    alphabets = dpfa.Alphabets;
    ifr = [numOfStrings];
    ffr = [];
    ftm = {[],[]};
    ftm{1} = dpfa.ProbabilityTransitionMatrix{1};
    atm = dpfa.AssociateTransitionMatrix;
    red = dpfa.RED;
    blue = dpfa.BLUE;

    for i = 1:lenOfState
    end
    dffa = DFFA(SetOfState, alphabets, ifr, ffr, ftm, atm, red, blue);
